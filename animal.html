        The cheetah was formally described by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1775 and is the only extant member
        of the genus Acinonyx. Its yellowish tan or rufous to greyish white coat is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000
        solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep
        chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches 70–90 cm (28–35 in) at the shoulder, and weighs 21–72 kg
        (46–159 lb).

    <p>The cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an induced ovulator. Gestation lasts nearly three months,
        resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of
        about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time.
        It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a carnivore and preys mainly upon
        antelopes. It stalks its prey to within 100–300 m (330–980 ft), charge towards it and kill it by tripping it
        during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their
        offspring in home ranges. Adult males are sociable despite their territoriality, forming groups called
        coalitions.

    <p>African cheetahs may achieve successful hunts only running up to a speed of 64 km/h (40 mph) while hunting due to
        their exceptional ability to accelerate; but are capable of accelerating up to 112 km/h (70 mph) on short
        distances of 100 m (330 ft). It is therefore the fastest land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the
        cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely
        depicted in art, literature, advertising and animation.</p>
